# nodekata
A collection of test code for Node ideas.  Many of the pieces are actual katas
from various websites.  Whenever I read a piece of code with an interesting idea,
I write tests against it to fully understand, or manipulate it to bring out other ideas.
Sometimes I'll delete a solution and rewrite it against an existing test to reinforce the
concept.  There's a lot of half finished stuff because it's not for production, just for play,
but I do try to keep the tests green ;
